``` r
library(raster)
```

    ## Loading required package: sp

    ## The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
    ## which was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.
    ## Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially
    ## https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.
    ## It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
    ## package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
    ## The sp package is now running under evolution status 2
    ##      (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
